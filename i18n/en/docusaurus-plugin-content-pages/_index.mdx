## Welcome to argumentation.online!

**_argumentation.online_ collects, reviews and publishes argument reconstructions of high quality and various complexity.**

The reconstructions of various levels of difficulty may be used free of charge for educational purposes â€“ be it by teaching staff at schools or universities or by students at such institutions.

_argumentation.online_ seeks to facilitate learning and to support teaching of argument analysis. This is based on the assumption that one can only increase one's ability to understand arguments by discussing a number of exemplary reconstructions and even more so by attempting to produce such reconstructions oneself.

There is no restriction as far as the topics of the arguments go that are published on _argumentation.online_; as it stands, however, most of the arguments currently analysed here come from philosophical texts. In terms of methods, _argumentation.online_ takes into account the diversity of theoretical approaches to arguments and presents both informal reconstructions as well as strictly formal analyses.
