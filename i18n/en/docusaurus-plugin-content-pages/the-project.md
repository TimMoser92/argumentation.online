# About the project

_argumentation.online_ collects, evaluates, and publishes high-quality argument reconstructions.

## Learning how to argue

_argumentation.online_ seeks to contribute to the teaching of and the education about argument analysis. This is based on the assumption that one can only increase one's ability to understand arguments by discussing a number of exemplary reconstructions and even more so by attempting to produce such reconstructions oneself. See also our [FAQ arguments and argument analysis](faq/).

## Free to use

The reconstructions of various levels of difficulty are published under a Creative Commons Lizenz ([CC BY-NC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)) and can thus be used free of charge for educational purposes – be it by teaching staff at schools or universities or by students at such institutions. Please make sure, however, to include a [complete citation](https://www.academics.de/ratgeber/zitierregeln-wissenschaft-korrekt-zitieren).

## Wide range of topics

There is no restriction as far as the topics of the arguments go that are published on _argumentation.online_; as it stands, however, most of the arguments currently analysed here come from philosophical texts. In terms of methods, _argumentation.online_ takes into account the diversity og theoretical approaches to arguments and unites both informal reconstructions as well as strictly formal analyses.

Inspired by _Just the Arguments. 100 of the Most Important Arguments in Western Philosophy_ (ed. by Micheal Bruce and Steven Barbone, Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), the idea for _argumentation.online_ originated during the [DFG Research Network „Argumentieren in der Schule“ ("Arguing at School")](link) and it continues to be developed there.
