# About the project

_argumentation.online_ collects, evaluates, and publishes high-quality argument reconstructions.

## Learning how to argue

_argumentation.online_ seeks to facilitate learning and to support teaching of argument analysis. This is based on the assumption that one can only increase one's ability to understand arguments by discussing a number of exemplary reconstructions and even more so by attempting to produce such reconstructions oneself. See also our [FAQ arguments and argument analysis](/about-arguments).

## Open access

The reconstructions of various levels of difficulty are published under a Creative Commons Lizenz ([CC BY-NC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)) and can thus be used free of charge for educational purposes – be it by teaching staff at schools or universities or by students at such institutions. Please make sure, however, to include a [complete citation](https://www.academics.de/ratgeber/zitierregeln-wissenschaft-korrekt-zitieren).

## Wide range of topics

There is no restriction as far as the topics of the arguments go that are published on _argumentation.online_; as it stands, however, most of the arguments currently analysed here come from philosophical texts. In terms of methods, _argumentation.online_ takes into account the diversity of theoretical approaches to arguments and presents both informal reconstructions as well as strictly formal analyses.

Inspired by _Just the Arguments. 100 of the Most Important Arguments in Western Philosophy_ (ed. by Michael Bruce and Steven Barbone, Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), the idea for _argumentation.online_ originated at the [DFG Research Network „Argumentieren in der Schule“ ("Arguing at School")](https://blogs.phil.hhu.de/argumentiereninderschule/), where it is still discussed and further improved.
